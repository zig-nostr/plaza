**Plaza** is a fast, local-first Nostr client, built natively in Zig. macOS (Apple Silicon), **ad-hoc signed (not notarized)**.

### What's new in v0.8.1

A maintenance release. Nothing here changes what Plaza does.

The permission model behind the signer, which decides what a connected app may do and for how long your answer stands, has moved into the `nostr` library that Plaza and Notary both build on. It was written twice, once in each, and two copies of a rule about what may sign with your key is one copy too many. Now there is one, with one set of tests over it, and both signers behave the same way by construction rather than by my keeping them in step.

### Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zig-nostr/plaza/main/scripts/install-macos.sh | bash
```

The installer downloads this release, verifies its SHA-256, installs `Plaza.app` to `/Applications`, clears the download-quarantine flag, and opens it.

It touches the app bundle and nothing else. Your key, your session and your local store live in `~/.plaza` and are left alone, so upgrading never costs you your identity.

### Why it is not notarized

Plaza signs notes with your key. The trust anchor for that is a build you can reproduce from source, not an Apple signature you cannot inspect. Read the [installer](https://github.com/zig-nostr/plaza/blob/main/scripts/install-macos.sh), or skip it and [build from source](https://github.com/zig-nostr/plaza#build): the same `scripts/package-macos.sh` that produced this artifact runs on your machine.

If you would rather not connect a key at all, Plaza reads without one, and every gated verb asks at the moment you reach for it.
